            PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game 
            developed by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese 
            film Battle Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for 
            other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first 
            game in the PUBG Universe series.The game is played from either a third-person or first-person 
            perspective. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for 
            weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available 
            safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever 
            tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. It was first 
            released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. 
            The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same 
            month, and officially released in September 2018. PUBG Mobile, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android 
            and iOS, was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming 
            platform was released in April 2020, with Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions being released in November 2020. 
            The game has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 12, 2022.
